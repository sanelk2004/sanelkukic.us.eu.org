I'm 17 years old. I started my programming journey when I was 12 and I've loved every bit of it. I currently know how to code in 4 different languages: JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java.

I love contributing to open-source software on GitHub and participating in events such as Hacktoberfest, I currently have been participating in Hacktoberfest for 3 years in a row!

As for my personal life, I live in the sunny U.S. state of Florida. I have two pet cats, whose pictures you can actually view by going [here](https://cats.sanelkukic.us.eu.org) and I am working towards my goal of becoming a state-certified public safety telecommunicator. I graduated from FLVS Full-Time High School in 2021 and am working to major with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Florida State University.

I also enjoy playing video games every now and then, you can view my profiles on the [Gaming](/gaming) page.
