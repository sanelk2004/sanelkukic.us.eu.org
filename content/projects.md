Below you can find a list of projects that I either created myself or contributed to. I'm quite proud of all of these and combined, they help me further my programming skills and experience immensely and I could not be more grateful that I was able to contribute to these projects. Feel free to click on the name of any project to be taken directly to that project's GitHub repository.
