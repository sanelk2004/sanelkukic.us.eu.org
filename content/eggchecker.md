Below, you can fill in the values of each easter egg that you found. Once you click "Submit", the site will tell you if
you have found all of the easter eggs and if they are all correct.

All 7 of them need to be correct. If they are correct, the website will automatically notify me via Discord. You must provide your email address so that I can contact you if your solutions are correct. If they are not correct, your email address is not saved anywhere and gets automatically disposed of. No logging, no nothing.
